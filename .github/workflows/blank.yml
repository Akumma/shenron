Sending SMS (sms-mt)

	Shortcode
	- Your shortcode suffix (last 4 digits)

	access_token
	- Contains security information for transacting with a subscriber. Subscriber needs to grant an app first via SMS or Web Form Subscriber Consent Workflow.

	address
	- Target number

	clientCorrelator
	- Uniquely identifies this create SMS request. If there is a communication failure during the request, using the same clientCorrelator when retrying the request allows the operator to avoid sending the same SMS twice.

	message
	- Must be provided within the outboundSMSTextMessage element. Currently, the API implementation is limited a maximum of 160 characters. Also make sure that your language or frameworkâ€™s editor is encoding the HTTP parameters as UTF-8

	- Contains security information for transacting with a subscriber. Subscriber needs to grant an app first via SMS or Web Form Subscriber Consent Workflow.

	address
	- Target number

	requestedAccuracy
	- The preferred accuracy of the result, in meters. Typically, when you request an accurate location it will take longer to retrieve than a coarse location. So requestedAccuracy=10 will take longer than requestedAccuracy=100

Charging

	endUserId / subscriber_number

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
